## Blockchain Integration Plan Tests
- ☐ Placeholder ABIs match expected contract structure
- ☐ Custom hooks prepared for blockchain integration
- ☐ Error handling for blockchain transactions
- ☐ Loading states for all transactions

## Known Issues
1. Image paths need to be updated to use correct paths in public folder
2. 3D models need to be added to the public folder
3. Linter warnings for implicit type any need to be fixed
4. Blockchain integration needs to be implemented

## Next Steps
1. Implement actual blockchain integration using wagmi hooks
2. Add real 3D models for each NFT tier
3. Implement IPFS storage for NFT metadata
4. Add server-side rendering support for SEO optimization
5. Implement comprehensive error handling for all blockchain interactions
6. Add unit and integration tests for all components
